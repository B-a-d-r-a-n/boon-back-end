## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
*   npm
*   MongoDB (either a local instance or a cloud-based one like MongoDB Atlas)

### 1. Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```

Install the required npm packages:
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project. This file will store your environment variables. Copy the contents of the example below and replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials.

**.env.example**
```env
# Server Configuration
NODE_ENV="Development"
PORT=3500
FrontEnd_url=http://localhost:5173

# Database
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@<cluster-url>/<database-name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority

# JWT Secrets & Expiration
JWT_SECRET=<your-very-long-and-secure-jwt-secret>
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=<your-very-long-and-secure-jwt-refresh-secret>
JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRES_IN=7d
JWT_COOKIE_EXPIRES_IN=7

# External API Keys
IMGBB_API_KEY=<your-imgbb-api-key>
```

### 3. Database Seeding

The project includes a seeder script to populate your database with initial data from the `/data` directory.

**Important**: The seeder requires at least one 'admin' user to exist in the database to assign products to. You may need to register an admin user manually first before seeding products.

To import all data (this will delete existing data in the collections):
```bash
npm run seed -- --import
```
To delete all data from the relevant collections:
```bash
npm run seed -- --delete
```

### 4. Running the Application

To start the server in development mode with live-reloading (using nodemon):
```bash
npm run dev
```
To start the server in production mode:
```bash
npm start
```The API will be available at `http://localhost:3500` (or the port you specified).
